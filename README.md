# SD_to_Harddrive
For use with a Raspberry pi


TODO:
* Pi must recognize sd card, and select correct folder
    -Should be something along the lines of /run/media/<user>/SD\ Card
* Pi must take all data from SD card and put it onto Harddrive
* Make new folder every time a backup is done, most likely with the date and time as the folder name
* Have a progress bar show up on an LCD Screen
* Must recognize a button (or a switch) press as input to start the program
* Possibly unmount SD card after program is done
* Program needs to start on startup. Preferably Headlessly
